- contact form
    - custom success page?

Onboarding upgrade thoughts:
- have a schedule to pick a time to have a skype interview
^^ this is golden, feature it as the main feature
..this could turn the contact form into a general 'hey whatsup'

- have file attachment for screenshot
    - directions for how to take screenshot
- prompt user to explain the goals of the website or app
- have success message that explains the next steps and what to expect


Future roll:
